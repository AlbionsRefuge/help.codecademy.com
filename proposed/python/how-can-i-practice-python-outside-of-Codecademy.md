title: How can I practice Python outside of Codecademy?
---
There are two ways you can practice Python outside of the Codecademy lessons. 

  1. You can use [Codecademy Labs][1], our online editor and interpreter. It works in offline mode as well as long as it has been loaded already.
  2. You can setup your local development environment. First, you will need to [install Python][2] on your local system. Once it is installed, you can either practice in the interpreter or practice by writing script files. See the appropriate section below for more details.

### Running the interpreter
Open a command prompt or terminal and type `python`. The interpreter should start and you can start writing Python code.

*Advantage*: You can see your code run live.
*Disadvantage*: Your code will not be saved.


### Creating and running script files
To create a script file and run it, follow these steps:

    a. Open a text editor of your choice (except for Microsoft Office Word). 
    b. Write your script.
    c. Save your script with a `.py` extension.
    d. Open up a terminal or command prompt and locate your script.
    e. Type `python <your-script>.py` (Python2) or `python3 <your-script.py` (Python3) to run your script.

*Advantage*: Your code will not be saved.
*Disadvantage*: You can see your code run live.
