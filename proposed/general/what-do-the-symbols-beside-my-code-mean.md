title: What do the symbols beside my code mean?
---

Symbols to the left of the line numbers are alerting you that something might be wrong with your code.

![alert symbols](https://raw.github.com/AlbionsRefuge/help.codecademy.com/what-do-the-symbols-mean/proposed/_assets/_img/what-do-the-symbols-beside-my-name-mean.png)

- A red shape with an X means there is a serious error. Serious enough that your code will not be able to run.
- A yellow shape with an ! indicates a warning or suggestion. Your code will run but it might not work as you had planned.
- A small i will appear for the least serious issues.

Hover your mouse over the symbols to see more information.
