title: Troubleshooting Guide

There are a number of things you can try if you are having trouble loading, viewing or submitting exercises. 

#### Check your Internet connection.
We recommend that you have a reasonably fast connection to the internet. Any broadband connection like DSL or cable should be sufficient. 

If you are at work or school or using a shared wireless network, there may be a firewall or proxy that is interfering with your connection to Codecademy. You can [read more about that here.](http://help.codecademy.com/customer/portal/articles/1414059-i-can-t-access-codecademy-through-my-firewall-)

#### Check your web browser.

**Codecademy works best on an up-to-date browser**. Please use http://browsehappy.com/ to improve your experience. We recommend Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Trying your lesson in a different browser is a good trouble shooting strategy.

**Check that all of your plugins are up-to-date too**.  Chrome, Firefox and Safari users can [use this site](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/) to check the status of their plugins. You don't need to have Flash installed to use Codecademy.

**Check your browser's  extensions**. Some extensions, like ad blockers and pop-up blockers, can affect your activities at Codecademy. Try disabling them, one at a time. Once you find out which one is interfering you may be able to configure it to ignore Codecademy. 

**Reload or refresh the web page** to reset any lost connections, especially *"Not connected. Trying in xx seconds."* messages. Refreshing will also clear out anything that may have loaded incorrectly.

**Clear your browser's cache** and restart the browser. 
Instructions for clearing your cache:  [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95582) / [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache)

**Check your zoom level**. If you have zoomed in or out on your browser you may see glitches in some exercises. To get back to 100%, press `CMD + 0` (Mac) or `CTRL + 0` (PC). 

**Tablets and mobile phones** are not fully supported yet, but you should be to complete most lessons on a recent, full-featured mobile browser running on iOS or Android.

#### Tried all that and still not working?

To see if others are having the same problem as you are:
