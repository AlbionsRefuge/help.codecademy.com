title: Can I link external libraries to my Codebits?
---
Yes! It's very easy to link external libraries to your Codebits in order to add extra functionality to your creation. To do so, simply follow these steps.
For this example, we are going to look at using Google-hosted libraries in our Codebit.

1. **Step One**: Find the library you want to use. Here is the list of [Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)
   
2. **Step Two**: Copy the snippet for the library that you want to use. You can find it under the library's name on the page listed above.
3. **Step Three**: Paste the snippet into your Codebit's code. We're using jQuery for this specific example.

  Note: If your Codebit's `script.js` requires jQuery (or another library you may choose), said library **must** be before your `script.js` in the code as seen above.
4. **Step Four**: Use the library.

That's it. Really.

The process is the same for any other library you may wish to use, just switch the URL to the library you choose.
