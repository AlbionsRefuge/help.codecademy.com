---

A fork is a copy. You can make a copy of any Codebit you see. After you do that the copy will be in your profile and you will be able to work on the code and change it as you wish.

To make a fork of a Codebit:

1. Find a Codebit in someone else's profile.
2. Hover your mouse within the border of the Codebit.
3. Click on the **fork** icon that appears.
4. Click on the blue **Fork** button.
