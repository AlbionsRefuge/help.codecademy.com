title: What editor should I choose?
---
The editor used by coders is purely based on their preference. A few popular editors today are:

  * [Sublime Text](1) **free unlimited trial (multi-platform)**
  * [Notepad++](2) **free (windows only)**
  * [Atom](3) **free (windows only)**
  * [Textmate](4) **free (mac only)**
  * [gedit (and derivatives)](5) **free (linux only)**

There are many types of text-editors and, as previously mentioned, they are subject purely to the discretion of the coder using them.

If the editor you wish to use is not listed here, feel free to use it anyway&ndash;It's your code.
