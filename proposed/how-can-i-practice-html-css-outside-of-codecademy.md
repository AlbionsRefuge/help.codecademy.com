title: How can I practice HTML and CSS outside of Codecademy?
----
With HTML and CSS, you can harness the power to create websites out of nothing. To practice them on your own outside of Codecademy, you can follow these easy steps:

  1. Install and configure your favorite code-editor to your liking. For help with this, see this article on [choosing an editor][1].
  2. Open the editor you chose and write some HTML or CSS or both just like you do here on Codecademy.
  3. Save the finished code somewhere that is easy to find on your computer with the ending ".htm" or ".html" for HTML or ".css" for CSS.
  4. Open any web-browser and go to "File > Open" and locate the finished HTML file or simply double-click your finished HTML file.
  5. View the rendered document in the web-browser. Edit your file with changes and reload to view them in real-time.
  6. Rinse and repeat until you achieve the desired effect.
