To use Python on your personal machine, you will need to start by [installing Python][1]. Once it is installed, you can either practice in the interpreter or practice by writing script files. See the appropriate section below for more details.

#### Running the interpreter
Open a command prompt or terminal and type `python`. The interpreter should start and you can start writing Python code.

  - **Advantage**: You can see your code run live.
  - **Disadvantage**: Your code will not be saved.


#### Creating and running script files
To create a script file and run it, follow these steps:

  1. Open a [text editor][2] of your choice. Microsoft Word is not a text editor.
  2. Write your script.
  3. Save your script as a plain text file with a `.py` extension.
  4. Open up a terminal or command prompt and locate your script.
  5. Type `python <your-script>.py` (Python2) or `python3 <your-script>.py` (Python3) to run your script.

  - **Advantage**: Your code will be saved.
  - **Disadvantage**: You cannot see your code run live.
