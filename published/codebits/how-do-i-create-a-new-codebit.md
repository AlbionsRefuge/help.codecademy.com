To create a new Codebit:

1. Go to your [Dashboard](http://www.codecademy.com/dashboard).
2. Scroll down to the **Codebits you're building** section.
3. Click on the **+ Create New** button.

If you don't see the **Codebits you're building** section, that means you haven't yet completed one of the Codebit projects from the [Learn](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) page.
