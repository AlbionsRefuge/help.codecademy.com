It's not possible to make your account private. However you can make your profile visible only to other Codecademy members.

1. Click your **Profile Picture** > **My account**
2. In the **Who can view my profile** section, change it to **Codecademy Users**.
3. Save your changes with the **UPDATE PROFILE** button.
