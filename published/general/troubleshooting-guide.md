There are a number of things you can try if you are having trouble loading, viewing, or submitting exercises. 

#### Reload the web page
This takes care of a majority of problems.

#### Check your Internet connection.
We recommend that you have a reasonably fast connection to the internet. Any broadband connection, like DSL or cable, should be sufficient. 

If you are at work or school or using a shared wireless network, there may be a firewall or proxy that is interfering with your connection to Codecademy. You can [read more about that here.](http://help.codecademy.com/customer/portal/articles/1414059-i-can-t-access-codecademy-through-my-firewall-)

#### Check your web browser.
- **Codecademy works best on an up-to-date browser**. Please use http://browsehappy.com/ to improve your experience. We recommend Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Trying your exercise in a different browser is a good troubleshooting strategy.
- **Check that all of your plugins are up-to-date too**.  Chrome, Firefox and Safari users can [use this site](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/) to check the status of their plugins. You don't need to have Flash installed to use Codecademy.
- **Check your browser's  extensions**. Some extensions, like ad blockers and pop-up blockers, can affect your activities on Codecademy. Try disabling them one at a time. Once you find out which one is interfering, then you may be able to configure it to ignore Codecademy. 
- **Clear your browser's cache** and reload the web page. Instructions for clearing your cache:  [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95582) / [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache)
- **Check your zoom level**. If you have zoomed in or out on your browser, then you may see glitches in some exercises. To get back to 100&#37;, press `Ctrl+0` (PC) or `Cmd+0` (Mac).
- **Tablets and mobile phones** are not fully supported. We recommend using a laptop or a desktop.

#### Tried all that and still not working?
To see if others are having the same problem as you are, check the **Q&A Forum** for your exercise. Look for the link in the bottom left of the exercise.
