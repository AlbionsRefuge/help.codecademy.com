Every language has its own [Application Programming Interface (API)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) which defines all its tooling and library features. Codecademy's Glossaries highlight the most common features and syntax for a language's API. They can serve as a useful guide when studying new languages or a handy reference when trying to remember tricky syntax.

Here are links to Codecademy's Glossaries and to each language's API:
